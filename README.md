# Water-Ripple-Shader
## Summary
    This project demonstrates a water ripple effect using OpenGL and GLSL. The effect is triggered by user interaction, specifically mouse clicks, which generate ripples on the water surface. Each ripple gradually fades away over time, creating a realistic water interaction effect. The ripple's intensity and fading are controlled by a fragment shader, part of a broader graphics pipeline managed in C++.
